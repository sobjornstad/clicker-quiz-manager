Changes in 1.0.1
----------------

- Show the total number of questions you've added so far when editing
  questions in a set, at the bottom of the list.

- You can now drag and drop items in the question and set lists to reorder
  them, rather than repeatedly clicking "Move Up" and "Move Down".

- Dialog boxes can now be resized correctly.

- Major under-the-hood performance improvements related to autosave.
  Everything should run much quicker now, at the cost that if the program
  completely crashes, you'll lose a minute or two of work. You can adjust the
  autosave frequency (1-5 minutes) in the preferences dialog.

- If the program encounters an unexpected error, display a warning and try
  to keep going rather than freaking out and crashing completely.

- You can now switch databases with File -> Open, and the last-used
  database is saved in the Registry so you don't have to select it when you
  start the program. Also, you can now create a new database from the File
  menu.

- You can now easily run a backup from the Tools menu.

- You can now randomize all answer choices for the current set in the
  question dialog, so you don't have to worry about evenly distributing the
  correct answer among all the possibilities so you don't end up with too
  many answer choices of 'a'.

- You can now start generating a quiz from the question dialog.

- Wrote backend code for creating a paper version of a quiz. In 1.0.1, this
  code is still inaccessible from the normal user interface, though.

- New markup for questions: ---> To insert a blank that's always of
  consistent length, write "[...]". ---> To write a foreign-language phrase
  and then an English phrase and have them rendered on separate lines with
  the second in italics, write "//" between them.

- Various small interface appearance improvements and bugfixes.
