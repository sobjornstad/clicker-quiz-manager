Changes in 1.0.3
----------------

This release is primarily bugfixes; while progress has been made on other new
features, they are largely not complete yet, and no significant changes will be
seen in the interface.

- Implement "view quiz" function to see the questions that were on past quizzes
  and export them to another format again.

- Properly save the database when closing by clicking the X button.

- Add HTML files that are necessary to export as HTML but were accidentally
  left out of the previous release.

- Add code to parse and import TurningPoint results files; this part is
  partially untested and cannot be completely used from the main user interface.

- Improve sorting in the students dialog: numbers will sort in numeric order,
  and case no longer matters.

- Fix the tab order in the question editor.

- Improve several error and confirmation messages.

- A collection of miscellaneous bugfixes.


Changes in 1.0.2
----------------

- Add students tables and editing interface.

- Add history dialog; none of the buttons yet work, but it does store quiz
  history.

- Add export routines for paper quizzes, HTML, and plain text.

- Allow using Ctrl-S along with Alt-S to save a question in the question
  editor.

- Fix missing access keys and links in the menus of the main window.

- Add preference to automatically select answer choice A, and to warn if a lot
  of correct answers seem to be "A" to go along with that.

- Some refactoring and under-the-hood improvements.


Changes in 1.0.1
----------------

- Show the total number of questions you've added so far when editing
  questions in a set, at the bottom of the list.

- You can now drag and drop items in the question and set lists to reorder
  them, rather than repeatedly clicking "Move Up" and "Move Down".

- Dialog boxes can now be resized correctly.

- Major under-the-hood performance improvements related to autosave.
  Everything should run much quicker now, at the cost that if the program
  completely crashes, you'll lose a minute or two of work. You can adjust the
  autosave frequency (1-5 minutes) in the preferences dialog.

- If the program encounters an unexpected error, display a warning and try
  to keep going rather than freaking out and crashing completely.

- You can now switch databases with File -> Open, and the last-used
  database is saved in the Registry so you don't have to select it when you
  start the program. Also, you can now create a new database from the File
  menu.

- You can now easily run a backup from the Tools menu.

- You can now randomize all answer choices for the current set in the
  question dialog, so you don't have to worry about evenly distributing the
  correct answer among all the possibilities so you don't end up with too
  many answer choices of 'a'.

- You can now start generating a quiz from the question dialog.

- Wrote backend code for creating a paper version of a quiz. In 1.0.1, this
  code is still inaccessible from the normal user interface, though.

- New markup for questions: ---> To insert a blank that's always of
  consistent length, write "[...]". ---> To write a foreign-language phrase
  and then an English phrase and have them rendered on separate lines with
  the second in italics, write "//" between them.

- Various small interface appearance improvements and bugfixes.
