Unicode to RTF command code conversion
======================================

This module implements an encoder for unicode to RTF 1.5 command sequences; it
can be used to generate valid RTF output with international characters.

Importing this module adds a new `rtfunicode` codec, allowing you to encode
unicode strings to valid RTF bytecode sequences:

>>> import rtfunicode
>>> u'RTF and unicode mix just fine! \u263A'.encode('rtfunicode')
'RTF and unicode mix just fine! \\u9786?'

The RTF command code for a unicode character is `\uN?`, where N is a signed
16-bit integer and the ? is a placeholder character for older RTF readers. This
module sets the latter to the '?' literal for simlicity's sake.


Limitations
-----------

This encoder does not support officially unicode outside the BMP (codepoints 
`\u0000`-`\uffff`). If you do pass in codepoints beyond this point, behaviour
depends on wether or not you have a python interpreter compiled with UCS-2
or UCS-4; the former will translate such codepoints using a surragate pair in
platform-dependent ordering, but with UCS-4, encoding using 'strict' will raise
a `UnicodeEncodeError` exception.

In any case, the RTF standard does not specify how codepoints outside the BMP
should be handled.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.4 or newer (including python 3.x)
