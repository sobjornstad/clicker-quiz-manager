To run the Clicker Quiz Manager, double-click on the 'runcqm' file. If you're
running Windows, you can first rename it to 'runcqm.py' so that the Python
interpreter will run it for you.

Before first run, you need to create a database file; you can do this by
running 'create_database.py' in the db/tools directory, then moving the file
whereever you like. On running the program, you'll be asked to select a
database file.

For more information on using Clicker Quiz Manager, look at the user manual in
the docs/ directory.
