RUNNING
-------

To run the Clicker Quiz Manager, double-click on the 'runcqm' file. If you're
running Windows, you can first rename it to 'runcqm.py' so that the Python
interpreter will run it for you.

On first run, you need to cancel the database selection, then choose File ->
New Database. I'm going to fix this up at some point.

For more information on using Clicker Quiz Manager, look at the user manual in
the docs/ directory.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

- Python 2.7
- PyQt 4
- sqlite3
- PyRTF (in the thirdparty/ directory)
- rtfunicode (in the thirdparty/ directory)

Additionally, to use the printed quiz function, you need to have LaTeX
installed, with a few packages which I will add a list of here later. In the
meantime, you can find out which ones they are by looking in the default header
in db/resources.

For development:
- pyuic4 (to rebuild modified Qt Designer files)
